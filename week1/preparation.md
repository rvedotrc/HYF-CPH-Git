# Preparation

This is the preparation for the "old style" presential classes (vs. flipped classroom).

Readings:
 - What is version control: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control (5 min)
 - What is git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-git (6 min)

Github:
 - if you haven't created an account on [github.com](www.github.com) yet, please create it now :)

Git:
 - please install git before Sunday:

  - for mac users: running `brew install git` on the command line should work;
  - for ubuntu people (or any debian based linux): run `sudo apt-get install git` on  the command line
  - for windows people: download Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org/) and install. Step by step instructions:
    1. execute the file you downloaded;
    2. on the `Information` screen, click next;
    3. on the `Select Destination Location` screen, click next;
    4. on the `Select Components` screen, click next without changing anything;
    5. on the `Select Start Menu Folder` screen, click next;
    6. `Choosing the default editor used by Git`, select `Use Vim` and click next;
    7. `Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new git repositories`, select `Let Git decide`
    8. `Adjusting your path environment`, select `Use Git from Git Bash only` and click next;
    9. `Choosing HTTPS transport backend`, select `Use the OpenSSL library` and click next;
    10. `Configuring the line ending conversions`, select `Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings` and click next;
    11. `Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash`, select `Use MinTTY` and click next;
    12. `Choose the default behavior of "git pull"`, choose `Default (fast-forward or merge)`
    13. `Choose a credential helper`, choose `Git Credential Manager Core`
    14.  `Configuring extra options`, select `Enable file system caching` and `Enable Git Credential manager`, click next;
    15. `Configuring experimental options`, do not select any of them, and click install;
    16. and you should be pretty much done :)
 
 - it is ***very important** that you do the following as well:
   - configure git by following the instructions [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nS-IvE7iJtUiUzxJdukXBFgt8OoAjuiY/view?usp=sharing);
   - set up your ssh keys by following [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDA4g3WcaHI_qbvOgB4cVLoVsi8HCcC2/view?usp=sharing). The instructions on Github can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).
 
 Optionally, if you are using Windows and want to use git bash on VSCode, check the instructions in the first answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42606837/how-do-i-use-bash-on-windows-from-the-visual-studio-code-integrated-terminal) on how to do that. If you are using linux or macOS, it works right out of the box.


We'll be roughly following the materials here, in case you want to take a look:  https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/Git/blob/main/week1/review.md
